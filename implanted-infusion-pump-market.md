<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implanted Infusion Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Programmable</li><li>Nonprogrammable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implanted infusion pumps are medical devices used to deliver medication into the body in a controlled manner. There are two main types of implanted infusion pumps: programmable and nonprogrammable. Programmable pumps allow for customization of medication delivery schedules and dose amounts, providing a higher level of flexibility and precision in treatment. Nonprogrammable pumps, on the other hand, deliver a constant flow of medication without the ability to adjust settings. Both types of pumps play a crucial role in managing chronic conditions and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
