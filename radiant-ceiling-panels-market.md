<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiant Ceiling Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Heating</li><li>Electric Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiant ceiling panels come in two main types: water heating and electric heating. Water heating panels are connected to a central boiler that heats water, which is then circulated through pipes in the ceiling panels to provide warmth. Electric heating panels use electricity to generate heat directly within the panels. Both types of panels provide efficient and effective heating solutions for various settings, such as homes, offices, and commercial buildings. Customers can choose the type of radiant ceiling panel based on their specific heating needs and preferences.</p></p>
