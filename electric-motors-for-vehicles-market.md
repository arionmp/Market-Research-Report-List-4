<p><strong>The Electric Motors for Vehicles Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)</li><li>Plug-In-Hybrid Vehicles (PHEV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric motors are widely used in Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles (PHEVs). In BEVs, electric motors are the sole means of propulsion, drawing power from a battery to drive the vehicle. On the other hand, PHEVs utilize both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine for power, with the electric motor typically being used for low-speed driving and the engine kicking in at higher speeds or when the battery is depleted.</p></p>
