<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Injected Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters</li><li>Conventional Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) are commonly divided into two main types: Power-Injected PICCs and Conventional PICCs. Power-Injected PICCs are designed to withstand higher pressures during contrast-enhanced imaging procedures, making them suitable for patients requiring frequent power injections. Conversely, Conventional PICCs are used for patients who do not require power injections and are inserted for longer-term intravenous therapy. Both types of PICCs provide a safe and effective way to administer medications and fluids directly into the central venous system.</p></p>
