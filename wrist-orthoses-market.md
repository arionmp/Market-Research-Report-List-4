<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>

<p><p>Wrist orthoses are split into two main types: dynamic orthotics and static orthotics. Dynamic orthotics provide support and stability while allowing for some movement and flexibility in the wrist. They are typically used for conditions like tendonitis or sprains. Static orthotics, on the other hand, immobilize the wrist and provide complete support.
