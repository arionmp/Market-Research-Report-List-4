<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Fieldmeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contacting</li><li>Contacting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrostatic fieldmeters come in two main types: non-contacting and contacting. Non-contacting fieldmeters use sensors to measure electric fields without physically touching the object, making them ideal for delicate or sensitive materials. Contacting fieldmeters, on the other hand, require direct contact with the surface to measure the electric field accurately. Both types have their advantages and are used in various industries such as electronics manufacturing, healthcare, and research laboratories to ensure safety and quality control.</p></p>
