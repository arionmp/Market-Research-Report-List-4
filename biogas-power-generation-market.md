<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Combustion</li><li>Internal Combustion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas power generation can be categorized into two main types: external combustion and internal combustion. External combustion systems involve burning the biogas to produce heat, which is then used to generate electricity. Internal combustion systems utilize biogas as fuel in engines to directly produce electricity. Both types of systems offer efficient ways to convert biogas into power, with external combustion being typically used in larger scale power plants and internal combustion being more common in smaller, decentralized applications.</p></p>
