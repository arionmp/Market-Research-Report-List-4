<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drug Coated Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Everolimus-Coated Stent</li><li>Zotarolimus-Coated Stent</li><li>Ridaforolimus-Coated Stent</li><li>SYNERGY Coated Stent</li><li>Orsiro Coated Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drug-coated stents are used in coronary artery disease treatment. Everolimus-coated stents, Zotarolimus-coated stents, and Ridaforolimus-coated stents are commonly used types. SYNERGY-coated stents combine a bioabsorbable polymer and Everolimus for improved healing. Orsiro-coated stents use a bioabsorbable polymer and a sirolimus drug. These stents help prevent restenosis by releasing medication directly at the site of blockage, promoting healing and reducing the risk of complications. Each type offers unique benefits and may be recommended based on a patient's specific needs.</p></p>
