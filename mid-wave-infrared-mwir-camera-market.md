<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled</li><li>Uncooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) cameras come in two main types: cooled and uncooled. Cooled MWIR cameras use a cooling system to maintain a constant temperature for the infrared detector, resulting in higher sensitivity and better image quality. These cameras are generally more expensive and bulkier due to the cooling system. On the other hand, uncooled MWIR cameras do not require a cooling system, making them more compact, cost-effective, and energy-efficient. However, they typically have lower sensitivity and image quality compared to cooled cameras.</p></p>
