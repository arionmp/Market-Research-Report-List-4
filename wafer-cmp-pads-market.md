<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard CMP Pads</li><li>Soft CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer CMP pads are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process to polish and planarize wafers. There are two main types of CMP pads: hard CMP pads and soft CMP pads. Hard CMP pads are typically made of rigid materials like polyurethane and provide high material removal rates. Soft CMP pads, on the other hand, are made of softer materials like polyurethane foam and offer better conformability to the wafer surface, resulting in improved uniformity and reduced defects in the final product. Both types play crucial roles in achieving high-quality wafer fabrication.</p></p>
