<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Assay Test Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Assays</li><li>Competitive Assays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lateral Flow Assay Tests are commonly utilized in two market types: Sandwich Assays and Competitive Assays. In Sandwich Assays, the target analyte is sandwiched between two antibodies, resulting in a visible signal indicating a positive result. In Competitive Assays, the target analyte competes with a labeled analyte for binding sites on the antibodies, leading to a decrease in signal if the target analyte is present. Both types of assays have various applications in medical diagnostics, food safety testing, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
