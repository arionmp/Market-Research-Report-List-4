<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Epoxy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber epoxy market can be segmented into two types based on the type of solvent used in the formulation - solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based carbon fiber epoxy products use organic solvents as carriers, while water-based products use water as a carrier instead. Solvent-based products tend to have better adhesion and durability, but can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the environment. Water-based products are more environmentally friendly, but may have slightly lower performance compared to solvent-based products.</p></p>
