<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Liner Hanger Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotating Type</li><li>Non-Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical liner hanger systems are divided into two main types: rotating and non-rotating. Rotating type liner hanger systems allow the liner to rotate independently of the casing, which can be beneficial during installation and cementing operations. Non-rotating liner hanger systems, on the other hand, do not allow rotation of the liner once it is set in place. Each type of system has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the well and operation.</p></p>
