<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HBOC</li><li>PFBOC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blood substitutes can be categorized into two main types: HBOCs and PFBOCs. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) are derived from human or animal hemoglobin and are used to deliver oxygen to tissues in cases of blood loss. Perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs) are synthetic compounds that dissolve and transport oxygen, mimicking the function of red blood cells. Both types of blood substitutes serve the purpose of restoring oxygen-carrying capacity in the absence of traditional blood transfusions, making them valuable in emergency medical situations.</p></p>
