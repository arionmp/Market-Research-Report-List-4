<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nickel Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pentlandite (Sulfide Ore)</li><li>Laterite-Nickel Ore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nickel mining market is characterized by two main types of ores - Pentlandite (Sulfide Ore) and Laterite-Nickel Ore. Pentlandite is a sulfide ore that typically contains high levels of nickel, copper, and platinum group metals. It is usually mined underground. Laterite-Nickel Ore, on the other hand, is a surface deposit that is easier and cheaper to extract. However, it usually contains lower nickel content compared to Pentlandite. Both types of ores are important sources of nickel production in the global market.</p></p>
