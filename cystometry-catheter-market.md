<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cystometry Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>3-Way Cystometry Catheter</li><li>2-Way Cystometry Catheter</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cystometry catheters are used in urodynamic testing to measure bladder pressure during filling and voiding. There are three main types of cystometry catheters: 3-way catheters, 2-way catheters, and others. 3-way catheters have an additional lumen for filling the bladder with saline solution. 2-way catheters are simpler, with one lumen for filling and measuring pressure. Other types of cystometry catheters may include specialty designs or additional features for specific testing needs. Each type of catheter has its own advantages and is used based on the specific requirements of the test being performed.</p></p>
